# AI Enablement Champion: Role Brief

## Executive summary

This document defines the AI enablement champion role and outlines the appointment process for division presidents and business unit general managers. Champions are influential domain experts who bridge AI team capabilities and practical implementation, driving adoption through hands-on training, workflow development, and coordinating measurement of AI adoption, fluency, and effectiveness.

**Action Required:** Division presidents and business unit general managers are requested to designate champions within their organizations by end of January 2026. Appointments should be submitted via email to the AI Enablement Team with champion names, areas of focus, and expected time allocation (a minimum of 20% is strongly recommended).

## Core responsibilities

**Self-training & validation**
- Deeply learn selected AI tools with AI team support
- Validate tools through real work scenarios before broader rollout
- Identify optimal use cases and workflows for their domain

**Team enablement**
- Deliver domain-specific workshops and hands-on coaching
- Provide pair programming, shadowing, and real project support
- Create and document team-specific workflows and best practices
- Enable training cascade so trained teams can train others

**Initiative coordination & tracking**
- Submit AI initiative proposals to AI Enablement Team outlining intended tools, use cases, and adoption strategy
- Coordinate measurement of AI adoption, AI fluency, and associated effectiveness
- Identify and escalate barriers to broader adoption
- Report progress to function leadership quarterly

## Time commitment

**20-50% time allocation** during active enablement phases (typically Q1-Q2 2026). Commitment is front-loaded and decreases as teams become self-sufficient.

## Support provided

Champions receive direct support from the AI team:
- Guidance on proposal development and tool selection
- Coaching and pair programming during self-training
- Access to validated tool portfolios and best practice frameworks
- Performance measurement infrastructure
- Regular progress reviews

## Selection & appointment

**Selection criteria:**
Champions should be individuals who are:
- Influential within their teams—people others trust and follow
- Deep domain experts with understanding of organizational workflows
- Proven change agents with track record of driving adoption
- Capable teachers willing to invest in team development

**Leadership commitments:**
- Release champions for the required time commitment during active enablement phases
- Integrate champion responsibilities into performance goals
- Each function should designate champions (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Service, Support Functions)
- Larger organizations may need multiple champions for diverse functional areas

**Manager alignment:**
- Champion's direct manager must be aligned and supportive of the role
- Champion responsibilities will be formally linked to their manager's performance goals
- Manager commitment ensures champions have protected time and organizational support for the enablement mission
