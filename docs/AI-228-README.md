# Champions Framework

Champion-led AI enablement operating model establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and governance for BU-driven AI adoption.

## Core Model

**Champion-led approach**: BU champions surface opportunities from ground up, central enablement team provides delivery support, governance prioritizes resource allocation.

## Key Components

### Champion Requirements
- Each BU/division must designate champion by end of January 2026
- Responsibilities: opportunity identification, funnel management, enablement coordination, progress reporting

### Confirmed Champions
- **Stephen Hlotyak**: Semi software engineering (spans four divisions)

### Operating Structure
- **70%** software engineering focus
- **20%** reserve capacity for other functions
- **10%** exploration and emerging opportunities

### Governance
- Enablement team separate from product team
- Queue management for resource allocation
- Pull-based support scaling with BU demand

## 2026 Goals Framework

**Candidate metrics**:
- Number of AI projects executed and rolled out
- Adoption rates (percentage of target users)
- Manager proficiency via certification completion
- Sustained NPS for AI-enabled tools
