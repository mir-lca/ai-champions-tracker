# Champions Coverage Tracking

Manual tracking system to monitor organizational coverage as division leaders appoint champions.

## Tracking Approach

### Simple Manual Method

Use this markdown table to track appointments as they come in:

| Division/BU | Champion Name | Focus Area | Time % | Est. Headcount Covered | Status |
|-------------|---------------|------------|--------|----------------------|--------|
| CTD | Stephen Hlotyak | Software Engineering | 30% | 405 (managers + ICs) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Robotics | Jacob Pilegaard | Software Engineering | TBD | 143 (managers + ICs) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Robotics | Martin Nordentoft | IT | TBD | 21 (direct + indirect) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Robotics | Fleur Nielsen | Marketing | TBD | 50 | ⏳ Pending |

### Coverage Calculation

**Two coverage models:**

**Model 1: Functional Coverage**
- When champion appointed for specific function (e.g., SW Engineering) → Count headcount in that function within division
- Example: Semi SW champion → Covers all SW engineers across Semi divisions

**Model 2: Division-Wide Coverage**
- When champion appointed for entire small division → Count all headcount in division
- Example: Small division appoints single champion → Everyone in division covered

**Combined Approach:**
- Large divisions will likely have multiple functional champions
- Small divisions will likely have single division-wide champion
- Track both and sum for total coverage percentage

### Current Tracking Status

**Confirmed appointments (3 total):**

| Division | Champion | Focus | Headcount Covered |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| CTD | Stephen Hlotyak | Software Engineering | 405 |
| Robotics | Jacob Pilegaard | Software Engineering | 143 |
| Robotics | Martin Nordentoft | IT | 21 |

**Current coverage:**
- Total org: 8,000 people
- Covered: 569 people (405 + 143 + 21)
- Coverage: 7.1%

**Pending proposals (1 total):**

| Division | Champion | Focus | Headcount Covered |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Robotics | Fleur Nielsen | Marketing | 50 |

**Projected coverage if pending confirmed:**
- Total org: 8,000 people
- Covered: 619 people (569 + 50)
- Coverage: 7.7%

**Future scenario (if additional appointments received):**

| Division | Champion | Focus | Headcount Covered |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Robotics | [To be appointed] | Product Management | 50 |
| Industrial | [To be appointed] | All functions | 300 |

**Projected coverage with all appointments:**
- Total org: 8,000 people
- Covered: 919 people (619 + 300)
- Coverage: 11.5%

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Number of champions appointed** (target: 1 per major function per division)
2. **Organizational coverage %** (headcount with designated champion / total headcount)
3. **Response rate from division leaders** (appointed / solicited)
4. **Gaps**: Functions or divisions without champions

### Weekly Update Cadence

**Every Monday:**
- Update table with new appointments
- Calculate coverage percentage
- Identify non-responders needing follow-up
- Report in weekly planning or leadership updates

### When to Escalate

**Red flags:**
- Division leader doesn't respond by Feb 7 (1 week past deadline)
- Champion appointed but not meeting selection criteria (not influential, no time commitment)
- Large gap in critical function (e.g., no SW engineering champion in major division)

**Escalation path:**
- Week 1: Email reminder
- Week 2: 1:1 conversation request
- Week 3: Loop in James Davidson for executive support
- Week 4: Escalate to Greg Smith if necessary
